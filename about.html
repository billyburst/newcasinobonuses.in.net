    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>NewCasinoBonusesUK was founded to give UK players a straightforward, honest place to find and compare casino bonuses. We focus specifically on no deposit offers — the kind where you can try a casino without putting your own money on the line first. Our small team reviews every bonus we list, checks the terms, and keeps things updated so you're not chasing offers that have already expired.</p>

    <p>We're based in Croydon, London, and we've been covering UK online casinos since the early days of the industry. Between us, we've seen hundreds of casinos launch, rebrand, and evolve. That experience helps us separate the genuinely good offers from the ones that look appealing but fall short once you read the fine print.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>Every casino and bonus listed on this site goes through a review process. We check that the operator holds a valid UK Gambling Commission licence, verify the bonus terms are fair, and make sure the offer is actually live before we publish it. If something changes — a bonus expires, terms are updated, or a casino loses its licence — we update or remove the listing.</p>

    <p>We also believe strongly in responsible gambling. Every page on our site includes links to support organisations like BeGambleAware, GamCare, and GAMSTOP. We're not here to encourage anyone to gamble more than they're comfortable with. Our job is to make sure that if you do choose to play, you have access to the best available information about the bonuses on offer.</p>

    <h2>Meet the Team</h2>

        <h3>Neil Cadwell</h3>
        <p class="role">Senior Casino Analyst</p>
        <p>Neil has been reviewing online casinos for over a decade. He started out as a player before moving into the editorial side of the industry, and he brings a practical, player-first perspective to every review. Neil handles the bulk of our bonus analysis work, digging into wagering requirements, win caps, and the finer details that most comparison sites gloss over. When he's not reviewing casinos, he follows the latest developments in UK gambling regulation and writes about how policy changes affect real players.</p>

        <h3>Billy Coin</h3>
        <p class="role">Bonus Specialist &amp; Co-Founder</p>
        <p>Billy co-founded NewCasinoBonusesUK with the goal of creating a no-nonsense resource for UK casino players. He specialises in tracking new casino launches and the introductory bonus offers that come with them. Billy maintains our database of active promotions and is usually the first to spot when a new no deposit deal goes live. He's particularly focused on free spins offers and has built up an extensive knowledge of which slots are most commonly used for bonus promotions and which ones tend to pay out best.</p>

    <h2>Our Standards</h2>
    <p>Transparency matters to us. When we link to a casino, we use affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission if you sign up through our site. This doesn't cost you anything extra, and it doesn't affect our reviews — we list and rank casinos based on the quality of their bonuses and terms, not on how much they pay us. If a casino has poor terms or a bad reputation, it doesn't make it onto our site regardless of the commission on offer.</p>

    <p>We only list casinos that hold a valid licence from the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC). This means every operator on our site is regulated, audited, and required to meet strict standards around player protection, fair play, and responsible gambling. It's the minimum requirement for any casino to appear on NewCasinoBonusesUK.</p>

    <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
    <p>We're always happy to hear from readers. Whether you've spotted an expired bonus, want to suggest a casino for review, or just have a question about how a particular offer works, you can reach us through our <a href="/contact">contact page</a> or email us directly at <a href="mailto:support@newcasinobonuses.in.net">support@newcasinobonuses.in.net</a>.</p>
